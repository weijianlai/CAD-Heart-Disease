# CAD-Heart-Disease
A data mining technique to detect heart disease using predictive model. The aim of the project is to create a predictive model using features from the patients to analyse and predict the occurrence of CAD, as well as identifying the predictors with the most impact on predicting the output. Predictive model is created using features from the patients to analyse and predict the occurrence of CAD. A website is then created for users to verify the likelihood of the users having CAD. The predictive model will calculate the output and display the result on the website.

The link to access the website that predict the occurrence of CAD is https://cadpred.shinyapps.io/FIT3164-CAD-Project/
